# RAWHTML

### What is it?

RAWHTML is a lightweight tool for validating HTML code with the use of the open API from [html5.validator.nu](https://html5.validator.nu).

### How to use it

Clone or download the project and place the `dist` folder in the root directory. Then import the script in all the HTML files by writing `<script src="/dist/raw.min.js"></scrip>`.

**Note that this tool requires you to run a local web server in order to work.**
